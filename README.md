# Internship-Description-Task-2

Abstract: This task need more research for wide angle. But with selection of the parameters it works in our case. Below is my suggestion not to select parameters by hands.

We need clear understanding what is fully visible parts. I guess that for paving stone is exact what we can see, but for wall bricks there might be some cases:

1) Assume that it's the same as for paving stones.
2) Bricks have a wider side, but it's rotated in angles and at the joints for a better connection, so we can see only smaller side of the brick. If we want to detect only bricks with visible wider side and other as parts there would be another solution. I choosed this option.
